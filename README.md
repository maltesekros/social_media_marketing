-------------------------
Neville Camilleri, Chris Micallef, Pawel Palusiak

Main idea is to offer a generic tool to be used as an interface to social media.
User's might be:
- The marketing team creating twitter or facebook campaigns to promote events.
- Bookies wanting to promote a very good bet on twitter during games.
- HR launching recruitment campaigns on LinkedIn.
- Product Owners wanting to analyse market trends.
- etc.
